# Mobile prototype

User interface prototype for participants has been created in Adobe XD. It presents early ideas of user flows and
system features â€” most of them are nice-to-haves and possible future enhancements rather than essential requirements for
the engineering thesis.

## Events

Prototype of events tab demonstrates searching and filtering events by phrase and date range. User can select an event
to see the details and can register as an event participant by pressing the call-to-action button.

| Event search                                                   | Event details                                                    |

## Requesting help

Mocked tab for requesting help consists of simple form to describe the problem, to decide on whether the conversation
with support is needed or not and to choose if one wants to remain anonymous. The model of a waiting screen presents
position in the queue and estimated time left to start the chat.

| Request for help                                              | Queue                                            |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|

## Chat

Chat window prototype includes not only sending text messages, but also file attachments like photos, audio and video
recordings. There is also a button to start video call with the organizer.
