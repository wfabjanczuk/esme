# Issues and comments

Agency can report and track issues described by the participants. All organizers have the privileges to create, read,
update and delete issues and comment on them. However, when it comes to comments only the author can edit or delete it.

Changing the issue status to either `resolved` or `cancelled` for the first time makes it closed and updates the
`timeClosed` field.
