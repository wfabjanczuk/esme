# Emergency Service for Mass Events

Engineering thesis under the supervision of mgr Piotr Gago. Defended in July 2023 at the
[Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology](https://pja.edu.pl/en/).

Implemented emergency service allows the participants to request help on mass events and to
start chats with the organizers. Requests for help are put in the queue first so the organizers
talk only to the number of participants they can handle in case of heavy application workload.
Being informed about the dangers, the organizers may send help or stop the event if necessary.
Organizers can create issues for monitoring the incidents and review history of all conversations.

This project is a **proof of concept** and a **learning experience**. It is not ready to use on a real mass event.
